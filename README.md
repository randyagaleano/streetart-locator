STREET ART LOCATOR
-----------------



OVERVIEW
-----------------
The purpose of this game is for a user to click a tile from a column of a specific catagory and answer correctly, winning whatever point is displayed on the front of said tile.
If the user response is correct, the score will be added to the scoreboard.
If the user response is incorrect, the score will be deducted and updated.

The tiles were made in javascript in order for me to get a better understanding of the language.
I made an array full of objects that would be the content inside the prompt by running everything in a for loop.
Within this for loop, I set the class of these tiles to match a style I created in my css file.
